This is the code of the shoppingcart function
I used Spring Tool Suit software with using jdk 11 for build this function
I used mysql workbench for create the database
The database file is “shoppingcart.sql”
Project is inside the “shoppingcart”zip file
Extract the zip file(shoppingcart)
Then you can run the program by using” http://localhost:8090/welcome”

Bellow tabs are related to my function:
