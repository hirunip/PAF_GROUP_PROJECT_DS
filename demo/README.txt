This is the code of Payment Managment function.
I used Spring tool suite software and jdk 11 for build the function.
I used mySQL workbench to create the database,my table is "Payment".
The database file is inside demo folder named as "database"(it is a zip file).
Extract it and with the use of demo folder you can run the programme.
In home page it has  "All Payments" tab to see all payment details table.
After you complete the order you can see the "payment" interface,after confirming the payment it shows the "all payments"  interface.
