This is the code of the User login & Registration function.

I used Spring Tool Suit software with using jdk 11 for build this function.

I used mysql workbench for create the database.

The database file is named as “Login_Database” .
Project file is named as  “Login_Function”.

Download both files (Login_Database, Login_Function) 

Then you can run the programme by using “http://localhost:8080/welcome”
On the web browser.

Bellow tabs are related to my function : 
Login
Singup
User Profile
